## Base URL

All requests include the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.scrapybara.com/v1
```

## Authentication

All requests to the Scrapybara API must include an `x-api-key` header with your API key. If you are using the client SDKs, you will set the API when constructing a client, and then the SDK will send the header on your behalf with every request.

## Content types

The Scrapybara API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the `content-type: application/json header` in requests. If you are using the client SDKs, this will be taken care of automatically.
